Hi, I'm Mirthe. Webdev from the Netherlands. Currently working for Aan Zee in Noordwijk. Work commits are stored in Bitbucket, I'm afraid, but some side projects can be found here. I blog (yes, people still do that) on [https://mirthe.org](Mirthe.org). You can catch me on Twitter as [https://twitter.com/mirthe](@mirthe), on Instagram as [https://www.instagram.com/mirthev/](@mival).
