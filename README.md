# Hi

I'm Mirthe Valentijn. Residing in the Netherlands. Former webdev at [New Story](https://www.newstory.nl) in Noordwijk, currently working as Project Manager for [Videodock](https://www.videodock.com) in Amsterdam. Most work commits can be found in Bitbucket, but some side projects can be found here on GitHub, though most repos are for private use. I blog (yes, people still do that) on [Mirthe.org](https://mirthe.org), since 2001. You can catch me on Twitter as [@mirthe](https://twitter.com/mirthe), mostly favoriting metal and/or scifi related tweets.
