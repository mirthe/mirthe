# Hi

I'm Mirthe Valentijn. Webdev from the Netherlands. Currently working for [Aan Zee](https://www.aanzee.nl) in Noordwijk. Work commits are stored in Bitbucket, I'm afraid, but some side projects can be found here on GitHub, though most repos are for private use. I blog (yes, people still do that) on [Mirthe.org](https://mirthe.org), since 2001. You can catch me on Twitter as [@mirthe](https://twitter.com/mirthe), mostly favoriting metal and/or scifi related tweets.
