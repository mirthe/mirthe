Hi, I'm Mirthe. Webdev from the Netherlands. Currently working for [Aan Zee](https://www.aanzee.nl) in Noordwijk. Work commits are stored in Bitbucket, I'm afraid, but some side projects can be found here on GitHub. I blog (yes, people still do that) on [Mirthe.org](https://mirthe.org). You can catch me on Twitter as [@mirthe](https://twitter.com/mirthe), on Instagram as [@mival](https://www.instagram.com/mirthev/).
